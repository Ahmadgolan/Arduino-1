This device connects to a smart phone via Bluetooth and acts as a remote control. It is a practical device in home or industry.
The circuit consists of 3 parts, Arduino uno, Bluetooth module HC-06 and Relay module, which we need one relay to control each device.
How to make the circuit:
The wires of the relay module and the Bluetooth module are connected to the Arduino as shown in circuit diagram.  Transfer the written program to the Arduino, disconnect it from the computer, and connect it to a 12-volt, 1-amp adapter.  We connect to the HC-06 module from the mobile phone and we can command the relays to be disconnected and connected, thus controlling the devices that are connected to the relays
